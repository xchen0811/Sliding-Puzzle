# Sliding-Puzzle
Our project is a two-dimensional game called Sliding Puzzle with 3x3 tiles. It is an essential two-dimensional game that challenges a player to slide flat number pieces along certain routes on a board to establish an end-configuration. The player needs to rearrange the tiles to the original order by sliding block puzzle without lifting any piece off the board.
